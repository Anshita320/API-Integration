#DESCRIPTION ABPUT THE TASK
The goal of this task is to create a dynamic and responsive webpage that integrates with a public API to fetch and display real-time data. This demonstrates your understanding of asynchronous JavaScript operations, API handling, and responsive design principles.

#INSTRUCTIONS
✅ Develop a webpage that fetches data from a public API (for example: weather, news, quotes, etc.).
✅ The webpage should dynamically load and display the fetched API data.
✅ Your page must be responsive, meaning it should work on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
✅ Implement proper error handling (e.g., “City not found” or “API unavailable”).

#DELIVERABLES
-A functional webpage using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla or framework like React, optional).
-API data should be fetched using JavaScript and displayed to the user.
-Include all required files in a GitHub repository:
index.html, style.css, script.js (or a single HTML file with embedded code is also acceptable).
